# Simulation of genetic data and analyses of both simulated and empirical data

## Msprime simulation
* MsPrime_CountTrees_AstacParam.py : This script is used to obtain the proportion of recombination events that happened after the split. The arguments need to be provided.
* MsPrime_SimulVCF_AstacParam.py : This script is used to simulate all the genetic data analysed in the manuscript. We adapted the migration rates, split time, and recombination maps used.
## Analyses of the simulated genetic data
* CorrelationsAndPRDI.R : This script is used to analyse and compute the correlation plot, the PRDI values, and PRDI plots.
  * "All_genome_replicate_pyrho_2kb.optimize" is on Dryad.
  *  "MigrRateSplitTimeDmsDmeData.txt" is in this folder.
