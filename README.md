# Data and code for "Rapid evolution of recombination landscapes during the divergence of cichlid ecotypes in Lake Masoko"

## Data
The recombination maps and the vcf are available on Dryad

## Analyses
* **Correlation and simulation analyses**
  * Calculating correlation on empirical and simulated data.
  * Determining the Population Recombination Divergence Index (PRDI) for (i) all the genome, (ii) inside and (iii) outside the local PCA outliers, and (iv) inside the significant local PCA outlier.
