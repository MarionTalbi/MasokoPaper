# Data for "Rapid evolution of recombination landscapes during the divergence of cichlid ecotypes in Lake Masoko"

The RecombinationMaps repository contains the following files:

1- All_genome_benthic_a_bp15_pyrho_chr.optimize.zip
2- All_genome_benthic_b_bp15_pyrho_chr.optimize.zip
3- All_genome_littoral_a_bp15_pyrho_chr.optimize.zip
4- All_genome_littoral_b_bp15_pyrho_chr.optimize.zip

These files are the raw inferred maps for the subsamples a and b for both ecotypes. 
The first column is the name of the chromosome, the second column is the starting position of the interval, the third column is the ending position of the interval, and the last column is the population recombination rate inferred for this interval.

The file containaing the mean recombination rate for the 9 bootstrap replicates and the VCF file used to infer the maos are uploaded on Dryad.
