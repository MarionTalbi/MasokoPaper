# Data and code for "Rapid evolution of recombination landscapes during the divergence of cichlid ecotypes in Lake Masoko"

## Data
The recombination maps and the vcf are available on Dryad

## Analyses
* **Correlation and simulation analyses**
  * Obtaining simulated data
  * Calculating correlation on empirical and simulated data
  * Determining the Population Recombination Divergence Index (PRDI) for all the genome and regarding local PCA outliers.

* **Relation with genomic differentiation**
  * Obtaining PRDI regarding the level of divergence (Fst and delta pi)
  * Look at the distance in recombination (between vs within ecotype)
